# 📚 Modulus Library

Welcome to **Modulus Library** - A Python package built with a touch of fun and practicality! This library provides a structured interface for data extraction, transformation, and machine learning workflows, making your life as a developer a bit easier. 🚀

## 🌟 Features
- **Abstract Base Classes** for model lifecycle management 🧠
- Easy to extend and implement your custom models 🛠️
- Built with Python 3.10+ compatibility 🐍

## 📦 Installation

Get started quickly by installing the package via Poetry:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/goabonga/plugins-lab.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd modulus-library

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

## 🚀 Usage

Here's a basic example of how you can get started using the `ModelInterface` class:

```python
from modulus.library.models import ModelInterface

class MyModel(ModelInterface):
    def extract(self, data):
        # Extract data logic
        pass

    def transform(self, data):
        # Transform data logic
        pass

    def load(self, X, y):
        # Load data logic
        pass

    def train(self, X, y):
        # Train model logic
        pass

    def predict(self, X):
        # Predict logic
        pass

    def save_model(self, filepath):
        # Save model logic
        pass

    def load_model(self, filepath):
        # Load model logic
        pass

    def retrain(self, X, y):
        # Retrain model logic
        pass
```
